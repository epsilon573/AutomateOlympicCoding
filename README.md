# AutomateOlympicCoding

  1. Paste the sublime build file into Packages/User and automate.py in the same folder as your cpp file.
  2. Change the name of the file from {code}.cpp__tests in automate.py to cpp file name you always use. This file name must always be the same.
  3. Launch the build system using Ctrl+B when you start solving a problem and it will parse the test cases in the background.
  4. Follow strict formatting, because "\n" in the end of the answer can cause it to not get accepted.
  5. Before launching the build system. Make sure you have the problem tab opened in your chrome.
  
  That's all enjoy.
